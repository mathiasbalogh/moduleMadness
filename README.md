MODULE MADNESS

The intent of this project is to illustrate the author's basic understanding of Node after one class.

Within this program:
	-Module one, named random.js, creates a random number between 100 and 1000000.
	-Module two, named monetize.js contains a function that takes in an argument, modifies it to a currency value and returns it.
	-Module three, named app.js takes in the functions from Module one and two, thus creating a dollar value between 100 and 1000000. Then, this number is concatenated to a string.
